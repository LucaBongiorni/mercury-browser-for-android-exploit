# Mercury Browser for Android Exploit
This repository contains two different files.  The first is ```libvplayer.so```, which is a custom native library that will execute ncat and start a bind shell through busybox when loaded.  The second file is the python script, which is used to exploit the path traversal vulnerability in the WiFiManager's custom web service.
